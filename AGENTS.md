- Don not use useEffect() as far as possible
- `default` shouldn't be used when exporting a component
- Do not use `else`. Consider that uses early return or make another method

## Name rule

- The name of the props type should be `Props` if it isn't exported to other components
- The name of the response type should be `Response` if it isn't exported to other components
